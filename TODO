General:

 - Throw new stuff into this category, or take stuff out of it if you want
   to work on it specifically.

 - Add descriptions to those .h files.  Sometimes it's hard to remember
   which one is which.  (i.e. confused me for a long time between the
   bot.h and gabot.h, I'm still confused though. =b )

 - display team names in main window
    - this way the user knows if the team loaded correctly (aside from error
      messages)

 - maybe have bot masses distributed normally around 5

 - there is a bool over() method in Game to tell if the game is over
    - currently counts turns, but I suppose it could be used if we want to
      end the game after a certain number of goals also
    - maybe it should emit a signal

 - SimpleGA is probably working. Call evolve(team) from a SimpleGA object on
   each team after each game. Crossover and mutation will be handled
   automagically.

 - need a button or menu item to play the game without displaying anything
    - disconnect signals/slots?
    - use a loop instead of QTimer
    - probably need to add a flag in botview to toggle the display on/off.

 - force to end and reset the current game after certain amount of ticks.

 - feature adding, in the summer

 - move CVS to someplace else.

Rich:

 - Develop cold fusion. Nothing is debunked until I say so.

 - Documenting header files that I've worked on

 - Keep fighting the signal war.

 - Need some way of telling the mainwindow that a game has finished.
    - see my notes on over() above - Chris
