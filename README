GABot a.k.a. Generic Algorithm Bot - was originally a school project from 
2002 by Edmond Lau, Chris Odorjan and Richard Voino.  The goal was to create
a game playing prototype based on Genetic Algorithms for our Artificial
Intelligence class at Wilfrid Laurier University.

Since the completion of the school project, the gang had many discussions
(over beer and wine) on how to revive the project, enhance the code and 
publish the project somewhere on SourceForge.  But after 8 years and much
alcohol consumed, we have decided to push the original code.  Hopefully,
someone out there will find this code useful.
